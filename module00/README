Python recommended version: Python 3.7.X
I have: Python 3.8.10
that's why I will use Anaconda:

Anaconda is a python and R distribution. It aims to provide everything you need (Python-wise) for data science "out of the box".

It includes:

The core Python language
100+ Python "packages" (libraries)
Spyder (IDE/editor - like PyCharm) and Jupyter
conda, Anaconda's own package manager, used for updating Anaconda and packages
Anaconda gives you the possibility to create a specific envirement.
ie: chose a specific Python version..

-I created a conda envirement called 42AI-$USER / 42AI-murphy, it contains:
	-python 3.7 
	-jupyter(notebooks) 
	-pandas(python libary) 
	-pycodestyle( a tool to check your Python code against some of the style conventions in PEP8)
	-numpy (python library)
